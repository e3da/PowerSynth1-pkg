## PowerSynth Project Overview
PowerSynth 1 is developed originally by the [MSCAD Lab](https://mscad.uark.edu/) and then joinly with the [E3DA Lab](https://e3da.csce.uark.edu/), at University of Arkansas. The PowerSynth 1 project is co-directed by [Prof. Alan Mantooth](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/mantooth/name/Alan+Mantooth/) and [Prof. Yarui Peng](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/yrpeng/name/Yarui+Peng/). 

The main features, models, and algorithms of PowerSynth 1 are summarized in the following papers:

* v1.1: Tristan Evans, Quang Le, Shilpi Mukherjee, Imam Al Razi, Tom Vrotsos, Yarui Peng, and H. Alan Mantooth, ["Powersynth: A Power Module Layout Generation Tool"](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2870346), IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, vol. 34, no. 6, pp. 5063–5078, Jun 2019, Highlighted Paper.
* v1.3: Yarui Peng, Quang Le, Imam Al Razi, Shilpi Mukherjee, Tristan Evans, and H. Alan Mantooth, ["PowerSynth Progression on Layout Optimization for Reliability and Signal Integrity"](https://doi.org/10.1587/nolta.11.124), IEICE Nonlinear Theory and Its Applications, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 124–144, Apr 2020, Invited Paper.
